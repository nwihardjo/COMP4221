# COMP4221: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Codes for HKUST COMP4221 Spring 2019: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

## Assignment

The codes for these assignment is connected to the remote server in HLTC lab in HKUST. Each assignment is designing a neural network model for each specific task in each assignment. The main model will be on `assignment.cpp` of each `src/` folder as well as the data used for training and testing. `analysis.py` on each assignment is the code for statistical analysis on the development data.

[Assignment 1](https://github.com/nwihardjo/COMP4221/tree/master/assignment1/src): super-basic NN model for POS (part-of-speech) tagger

[Assignment 2](https://github.com/nwihardjo/COMP4221/tree/master/assignment2/src): NN model for POS tagger based on the surrounding context and feature engineering

[Assignment 3](https://github.com/nwihardjo/COMP4221/tree/master/assignment3):
- [Part A](https://github.com/nwihardjo/COMP4221/tree/master/assignment3/part_a): NN model for IOBES tagger based on the POS tagger on Assignment 2
- [Part B](https://github.com/nwihardjo/COMP4221/tree/master/assignment3/part_b): NN model for shallow syntactic parsers
- [Part C](https://github.com/nwihardjo/COMP4221/tree/master/assignment3/part_c): NN model for shallow semantic parsers
